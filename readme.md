# Introduction

Nextion Arduino library provides an easy-to-use way to manipulate Nextion serial
displays. Users can use the libarry freely, either in commerical projects or 
open-source prjects,  without any additional condiitons. 

For more information about the Nextion display project, please visit 
[the wikiã€‚](http://wiki.iteadstudio.com/Nextion_HMI_Solution)  
The wiki provdies all the necessary technical documnets, quick start guide, 
tutorials, demos, as well as some useful resources.

# Download Source Code 

Latest version is unstable and a mass of change may be applied in a short time 
without any notification for users. Commonly, it is for developers of this 
library. 

**Release version is recommanded for you, unless you are one of developers of this 
library.**

**Release notes** is at
<https://github.com/itead/ITEADLIB_Arduino_Nextion/blob/master/release_notes.md>.

## Latest(unstable)

Latest source code(master branch) can be downloaded:
  <https://github.com/itead/ITEADLIB_Arduino_Nextion/archive/master.zip>. 

You can also clone it via git:

    git clone   https://github.com/itead/ITEADLIB_Arduino_Nextion
    fixed clone https://github.com/ersinkecis/ITEADLIB_Arduino_Nextion_ALL_FIXED

## Releases(stable)

# Documentation

Offline Documentation's entry `doc/Documentation/index.html` shiped with source code
can be open in your browser such as Chrome, Firefox or any one you like. 

# Suppported Mainboards

**Now, All boards, can be supported. :)**

For example:

  - Arduino Nano, ESP8266 and etc. :)
  - Iteaduino MEGA2560
  - Iteaduino UNO
  - Arduino MEGA2560
  - Arduino UNO

# Configuration

In configuration file NexConfig.h, you can find two macros below:

  - dbSerial: Debug Serial (baudrate:9600), needed by beginners for debug your 
    nextion applications or sketches. If your complete your work, it will be a 
    wise choice to disable Debug Serial.

  - nexSerial: Nextion Serial, the bridge of Nextion and your mainboard.

**Note:** the default configuration is for NANO, ESP8266 and all others.

## Redirect dbSerial and nexSerial

If you want to change the default serial to debug or communicate with Nextion ,
you need to modify the line in configuration file:

	#define dbSerial Serial    ---> #define dbSerial Serialxxx
    #define nexSerial Serial2  ---> #define nexSerial Serialxxx

## Disable Debug Serial

If you want to enable the debug information,you need to modify the line in 
configuration file:

    //#define DEBUG_SERIAL_ENABLE ---> #define DEBUG_SERIAL_ENABLE

# UNO-like Mainboards

If your board has only one hardware serial, such as UNO, you should disable 
dbSerial and redirect nexSerial to Serial(Refer to section:`Serial configuration`).
